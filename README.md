# Designs

This project is a collection of my CAD designs for 3D printing using a Bambu Lab A1 with AMS. This probably could be used for other printers and materials, but it's not tested.

Some designs are created with [LuaCAD](https://github.com/ad-si/LuaCAD) which transpiles Lua to OpenSCAD (`.scad`). While, others are built in [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).
